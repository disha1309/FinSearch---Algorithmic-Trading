# FinSearch---Algorithmic-Trading
This report details the importance and utilisation of aspects of Artifical Intelligence like Reinforcement Learning
in perceiving data and making accurate predictions, particularly in the domain of Stock Trading strategy. The
project takes inspiration from the paper ”Reinforcement Learning in Stock Trading” by Quang-Vinh Dang, and
makes use of the NIFTY50 stocks from Jan-2010 to Jun-2019 as the training data. Although automation has found
its way into trading, the focus of this project is to examine why Reinforcement Learning is a more accurate option
as compared to standard Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms.This paper adopts reinforcement learning to the
problem of stock price prediction regarding the process of stock price changes as a Markov Decision process. The
process of stock price changes is modeled as a state, action, reward, policy, etc. For this project we assume each
investor(agent)’s policy and actions can be implicitly reflected into the stock data such as a chart showing series of
changes of stock prices
